## Utility scripts and macros for Muon Collider detector simulation


### BIB conversion scripts

These scripts convert a BIB sample from the format of an external tool to the format suitable as input for the Muon Collider simulation framework. Several different scripts are available for different data formats.

Typically we do some filtering of particles during the conversion step, to exclude those that will not contribute to the digitised detector hits, such as slow neutrons or times arriving too late after the bunch crossing.  
See available options in each script do: `python3 <script>.py --help`

#### FLUKA -> LCIO

`fluka_to_slcio.py` - converts a BIB sample generated in FLUKA (stored in a custom binary format) to LCIO format

Typical use example:

```bash
python3 fluka_to_slcio.py input1.dat input2.dat ... inputN.dat output.slcio
```

By default it will combine all particles from each input `.dat` file into a separate event in the output `.slcio` file, e.g. sample of 5 input files with 200 particles/file will be stored as 5 events with 200 particles/event in the output file.

> **ATTENTION:**
> Absolute time of each particle has to be corrected by the bunch-crossing time, which is defined by the `-b` option, whose value might be different from the default one. Please, ensure that the correct value is used for each sample.

Several useful options are available:

* `-f N` - combines `N` input files into a single event
* `-n N` - creates `N` copies of each input particle randomly distributed in Phi, to increase statistics

#### MARS15 -> LCIO

`bib_to_slcio.py` - converts a BIB sample generated in MARS15 (stored in a custom text format, 1 particle/line) to LCIO format

Typical use example:

```bash
python3 bib_to_slcio.py --weight 400000 --decays 5000000 input_file output.slcio
```

> **ATTENTION:**
> To have correct normalisation, copies of each particle are created, randomly distributed in Phi, according to the factor calculated from the `--weight` and `--decays` command-line parameters of the script. The `--decays` parameter represents the number of initial muon decays simulated for the input file, and is encoded in the name of the file, e.g. for file `mumi-5e6-40m-lowth` you should use `--decays 5000000`. Then, assuming the nominal beam intensity of `2e11` muons per bunch you should use `--weight 400000` to obtain the desired `5e6 * 4e5 = 2e11` initial decays.

Each line of the input MARS15 file has a particle definition in the following format:

```csv
NI,JJ,X,Y,Z,PX,PY,PZ,TOFF,W,ZDEC,XORIG,YORIG,ZORIG,WORIG,EORIG,IORIG,KORIG
FORMAT(I11,I7,3F11.3,11(1PE14.6),I7,I3)
```

with the following meanings:
* `NI` - history number
* `JJ` - particle ID, reaching detector
* `X,Y,Z` - coordinates on interface surface (cm)
* `PX,PY,PZ` - momentum components  (GeV/c)
* `TOFF` - time with respect to bunch crossing.
* `W` - particle weight.
* `ZDEC` - decay coordinate along beam line.
* `XORIG,YRIG,ZORIG` - coordinate of particle origin (cm),
* `WORIG,EORIG,IORIG` - weight, energy, particle ID of  particle origin
* `KORIG` - type of process in which particle were created

Particle ID definitions in the MARS15 files are the following:
